The code began as the broken project of a classmate, and I was able to get it operating. Unfortunately, one must be on UNCW's servers
  to view the website. I did not have much say as to how the front end looked, but the operations and backend functions work smoothly using
  mostly php (and applying lessons taught through learning javascript).
